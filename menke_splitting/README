Note: Is it better to solve for just two parameters per layer (i.e. delay
and fast axis orientation, making the near-vertical incidence approximation)
or four (i.e. layer thickness, hexagonal tensor oblateness and strike and
dip of symmetry axis, and allowing for oblique incidence, and possibly
putting in a free-surface correction?  On the one hand four-parameters
would be more accurate, but on the other two parameters may be all the
data can actually resolve.  For the one-layer case I provide software to
do both, and suggest that you use both, and use an F-test to determine
whether the reduction in error provided by the 4-parameter case is really
significant.

ah_cross_conv_1            Determine fast azimuth and delay for single anisotropic layer
			   using one near vertical incidence radially polarized 
			   (e.g. SKS) waveform.  Uses vertical incidence impulse
			   response functions.

ah_cross_conv_1_unk_pol    Determine fast azimuth and delay for single anisotropic layer, and
			   initial polarization using one near vertical incidence
			   waveform of unknown polarization.  Uses vertical incidence impulse
			   response functions.

ah_cross_conv_1_group      Determine fast azimuth and delay for single anisotropic layer
			   using a group of near vertical incidence radially polarized 
			   (e.g. SKS) waveforms.  Uses vertical incidence impulse
			   response functions.

ah_cross_conv_1t_group     Determine thickness, hexagonal tensor oblateness and
                           strike and dip of symmetry axis for single anisotropic layer

			   Uses oblique incidence impulse response functions, with
			   optional free-surface correction.

ah_cross_conv_2            Determine fast azimuths and delays for two anisotropic layers
