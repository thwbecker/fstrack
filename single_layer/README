splitting for flow model output tensors (splitting in each 50 km layer
separately):

convert_to_cijkl.cmd is a script to take six tensors (depths 50,100,...,300
km) and convert from Cij to cijkl format with density normalisation (density
is hardwired) - calls c6x6to81_dens

tensor_phase calculates splitting parameters in the SKS/SKKS incidence angle
range for each tensor. parameters incidence angle, azimuth, x and y
component of fast S direction, fast azimuth, and splitting time over 50 km
layer thickness are output in depth_???.out, ascii format
uses subroutines in slowness
