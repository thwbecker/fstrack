those were comments from Vera in 07/2005:

Here six tensors from two papers. Density is not given
in the papers, but it should be fine to set it to 3.353
as before.

xenolith samples from Ji, Zhao, Francis Tectonophys 1994:
ji_castlerock, ji_alligator, ji_nunuvak. Cij at mantle P/T for
component where p/T-derivatives available.
density not given.

olivine fabric averages from Ismail & Mainprice Tectonophys 1998:
ismain_fastspreading, ismain_subduction, ismain_kimberlites. Cij were
determined by measuring individual olivine crystal orientations, then
taking Kumazawa & Anderson 1969 olivine elastic constants at 700K/300MPa
(upper mantle) and taking Voigt average. Statement on p.147 that anisotropy
is P/T independent because dCij/dT and dCij/dP are linear is wrong (only
if they are identical between Cijs).
fastspreading: very much like olivine, c up, a N-S.

rhofix_* are tensors converted to GPa / 3353 kg/m^3. Probably ok for 
Ismail & Mainprice Cij since those are based on olivine Cijs at
mantle P/T. 
density may be off, but here just taken as scale factor (rho shouldn't
affect aniso effects).

useful exercise may be to look at change of anisotropy when correct
dCij/(dT,dP) are applied.
