sixtensors.cmd in the main calling script, loops over
incident azimuths. it calls:

anicake - calculates harmonic response of a layer stack with
arbitrary anisotropies (no dipping interfaces allowed, but
symmetry axes by in any direction including plunge). incidence
is in x-z plane, hence the awkwardness in rotating the tensors
rather than shooting rays in at different angles. ray parameter
(i.e. incidence angle) is input parameter. output is cake_out.

spectoseis - takes response spectra from anicake (cake_out)
and calculates seismograms in impulse response (stick) and 
filtered form. output in comb_out and aniso_filt_out, 
respectively.

skssplit_xcorr - calculates shear wave splitting by
cross correlation, input aniso_filt_out, output skssplit_out
(appends to latter with each run of loop to make a list
as a function of incidence angle). output is
ray parameter, rotation angle, fast azimuth in rotated system,
and dt in s.
