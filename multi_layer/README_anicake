anicake calculates the harmonic response of a stack of anisotropic layers
at a number of frequencies. The layer matrix formalism follows Kennett's
book, with anisotropic extensions by Peter Shearer (see references below).

The input parameters are in files such as singleaz_run. All layers
are anisotropic (define isotropic layer with quasi-zero anisotropy - 
anisotropy of exactly zero leads to instabilities). The free surface
is defined by an air layer on top. 

The code has some predefined models of anisotropy (see gethex), but
all calculations are performed for the general anisotropic case, so
any symmetry can be used. The predefined models are used to
calculate the general elastic tensor, so this step can be omitted and
an arbitrary tensor can be used as direct input (option 9).

The tensors in the layers can be individually rotated around the vertical
axis (for incidence on different azimuths) and tilted relative to the
layering. The axes are 1 = horizontal along the layer plane, 2 = horizontal
into the layer plane, and 3 = vertical (positive down).

The layercake response is calculated at increments in frequency from
fmin to fmax, also given in the parameter file. The response could
be output for reflection or transmission at any of the interfaces.
For the free surface case it's set to transmission at the air-solid
interface.

The incidence angle of the plane wave is given by the ray parameter in
s/km.

After anicake calculates the reflection/transmission matrix and
eigenvectors, aniso_transient calculates the spectra and performs
an IFFT to produce stick seismograms of displacement. I convolve
these with the source function in matlab and differentiate to get 
the velocity seismograms for comparison with fd3. aniso_transient_out
has time, incident P x, y, z, incident SV x, y, z, incident SH x, y, z.

Overall, since we perform an integration over frequency but not
over slowness, this is not quite a real reflectivity code. However,
since we're dealing with plane waves, the slowness integration
is redundant and the results should be identical to the full
reflectivity case.

sorting of eigenvectors and z axis orientation: z is positive down
see comment from anieigen.f:
c subroutine ANIEIGEN calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
c for a general anisotropic solid for a given horizontal slowness.
c
c Six solutions are obtained,and are sorted as follows:
c     (1) = downgoing qP    (positive or larger vertical slowness
c     (2) = downgoing qSP         or larger imag. part)
c     (3) = downgoing qSR
c     (4) = upgoing qP      (negative or smaller vertical slowness
c     (5) = upgoing qSP           or smaller imag. part)
c     (6) = upgoing qSR
c
c If no symmetry axis is specified, i.e. sym(i)=0., then the qSP and qSR
c indices correspond to the faster and slower solutions, respectively.
c This sorting scheme has not been entirely debugged, and may give
c unpredictable results, especially for extremely anisotropic models
c and/or evanescent waves.
c
c Program is based on equations which can be found in Keith & Crampin
c (GJRAS 49, 209-223, 1977), Crampin (Wave Motion 3, 343-391,1981), and
c Garmany (GJRAS 75, 565-569, 1983).


aniso_t_S (../s_anicake):

1. read upgoing eigenvectors in top layer (output is set to transmission in top
   layer, so refl/trans matrices for packet have to be multiplied by EVs in air
   layer to get seismograms)
   
2. for P, there is a polarization ambiguity (dilatation/compression) for the
   bottom layer eigenvectors, i.e., even when picking the upgoing slowness it
   may have dilatation or compression particle motion. To get compression 
   consistently, read bottom layer EVs, check pz sign, and if pz component
   is positive (= down, i.e. dilatation), multiply solution by -1 in aniso_t_S
   (all three components)
   
3. the polarization 180deg ambiguity is not relevant for S splitting analysis
   since fast direction is axial.
   
4. generally, refl/trans matrix describes top layer EV given the bottom layer EV.
   to choose S wave polarization, one could see what coefficients are necessary
   to build desired initial polarization from the bottom layer 2 S eigenvectors,
   then use the same coefficients to build the desired result from the solution
   for the top EVs.
