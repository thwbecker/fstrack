FSTRACK PACKAGE

- fstrack: set of routines to trace particles in mantle flow and
	compute LPO. Routines use precomputed velocities on GMT grd
	files.
	
	The package also provides a range of anisotropic tensor
	anylsis and splitting tools. Those do not require the flow
	package including GMT and netcdf and can be compiled
	independently.

	See (and cite, if used):

	The most recent paper using different types of LPOs etc:

	Becker et al. (EPSL, 267, 213-237, 2008)

	and for more detail on aspects of the approach

CONTENTS:

The tar file includes this README, and installation script
"install_fstrack" and several subdirectories

eispack/ has eigenvector routines
single_layer/
multi_layer/  are splitting routines
d-rex/ holds the DREX LPO and anisotropy routines
hc/ is a flow solver


INSTALLATION:

Short version: There is a script, "install_fstrack" which will by
default try to install the package without flow tracking, and can be
called, alternatively, as "install_fstrack 1" to try to install
everything, including the flow tracker (but see below).

PREREQUISISTES FOR THE FLOW PART (NOT FOR THE REST)

1) GMT, version 4 (not 5)

   http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt4/

2) netcdf

   http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

   Environment variables $GMTHOME and $NETCDFDIR have to be set to the
   GMT and netcdf directories, and HC installed, respectively. (The
   FSE trackers uses netcdf grd files to read in velocity fields.) In
   my case, those variables point to

> echo $GMTHOME/
/usr/local/src/gmt-4.5.16/

> echo $NETCDFDIR/
/usr/local/src/netcdf-3.5.0/

   
NOTES:

The file "install_fstrack" is a simplified version of these
installation instructions.


This tar file will expand three directories, eispack, d-rex and
fstrack, for eigenvalue routines, the DREX package and the finite
strain tracker, respectively. 

You will need a C, F77, and F90 compiler. Make sure your Fortran and C
compiler flags are set with environment variables CFLAGS and FFLAGS
(normally they should be already).

Some F90 code expects to be able to use C preprocessor statements, in
Intel Fortran, this is done by

ifort -fpp

for gfortran F90 code by 

-x f95-cpp-input 

for gfortran F77 code by 

-x f77-cpp-input

See the machine_dependent.*.* files for suggestions for typical compiler flags. 

For Intel, I use

> echo $CC $CFLAGS
icc -O2 -xW -vec_report0 -static

> echo $F77 $FFLAGS
ifort -O2 -xW -vec_report0 -static -fpp -nofor-main 

> echo $F90 $F90FLAGS
ifort -O2 -xW -vec_report0 -static -fpp -nofor-main


For GNU, the following setting should work:

echo $CC $CFLAGS
gcc -O2 -Wall -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer 


echo $F77 $FFLAGS
gfortran -x f77-cpp-input -O2 -Wall -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer

echo $F90 $F90FLAGS
gfortran -x f95-cpp-input -O2 -Wall -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer

       Here are example Intel and GNU compiler setups:

 if [ $use_intel -eq 1 ];then
      export F77=ifort
      export F90=$F77
      export CC=icc
      export LDFLAGS="-lm"
      export CFLAGS="-O3 -DLINUX_SUBROUTINE_CONVENTION"
      export CFLAGS_DEBUG="-g -DLINUX_SUBROUTINE_CONVENTION"
      export FFLAGS="-O3 -fpp -nofor-main"
      export FFLAGS_DEBUG="-g -fpp -nofor-main"
      export F90FLAGS=$FFLAGS
      export F90FLAGS_DEBUG=$FFLAGS_DEBUG
      export F_EXT_SOURCE_FLAG=-extend_source 
      export FTRN_LIB="-lifcore"
      export MATHLIBS="-mkl"

  else
      export F77=gfortran
      export F90=$F77
      export CC=gcc
      export LDFLAGS="-lm"
      export CFLAGS="-O3 -DLINUX_SUBROUTINE_CONVENTION"
      export CFLAGS_DEBUG="-g -DLINUX_SUBROUTINE_CONVENTION"
      export FFLAGS="-O3 -x f77-cpp-input"
      export FFLAGS_DEBUG="-g -x f77-cpp-input"
      export F90FLAGS="-O3 -x f95-cpp-input" 
      export F90FLAGS_DEBUG="-O3 -x f95-cpp-input" 
      export F_EXT_SOURCE_FLAG=-ffixed-line-length-132 
      export FTRN_LIB=-lgfortran
      export MATHLIBS="-llapack -lblas" 
  fi



###

The makefile will look for a file machine_dependent.$ARCH where any
additional flags can be set, else will use existing environment
variables.

Procedure:

1) Go to eispack and d-rex directories and make

	First go to eispack, type 'make', then to d-rex and type
	`make', this should build the DREX based libraries (for
	copyright see note above).

2) 

A) Go to the fstrack directory, and type 'make' 

This will install anisotropy and splitting tools, but not the flow tracker etc.

B) Type  'make really_all' and this will attempt to install the flow tracker, for ppre-reqs, see above


USAGE:

The main program is 'fstrack', start with -h option for man
page. Same for other routines. 


STATUS:

Experimental.
